# apiWeatherDashboard

I was tasked to create a Weather Dashboard for a travler. They wanted see the weather outlook for multiple cities so they can plan a trip accordingly. I created a Weather Dashboard that allows them to see the current weather, 5 day forcast, and uv index of the city they searched. They are also able to click a button to see previous searched citys incase they travel to repeted city often.
